# Reddit API Integration for Content Insights

## 🎯 Why Reddit is the Perfect Addition

Reddit surfaces **real user questions and pain points** that often don't appear in traditional SEO research. This makes your articles more practical and useful.

### The Power of Community Insights

**SerpAPI gives you:**
- Real search results
- Related questions from Google
- Competition analysis

**Reddit adds:**
- ❓ **Real user questions** - What people actually ask in communities
- 😫 **Pain points** - What struggles people are facing
- 💡 **Solution requests** - What help they need
- 🏆 **Popular discussions** - What topics are trending

## 💡 Example: How Reddit Changes Content

### Without Reddit (SerpAPI only)
**Questions found:** "What is SOC 2 compliance?"
**Result:** Generic, high-level content

### With Reddit
**Questions found:**
- "Struggling with SOC 2 evidence collection - any tools?"
- "How much does SOC 2 really cost? Vendors say $10k, we spent $50k"
- "SOC 2 timeline for a 5-person startup - realistic?"
- "Got failed on access controls during audit - common?"

**Result:** Practical, real-world content that addresses actual struggles!

## 🔧 No Setup Required!

Reddit's public JSON API is free and requires:
- ✅ No API key
- ✅ No authentication
- ✅ No rate limits (be respectful though!)
- ✅ Works immediately

## 📊 What You Get

insights.questions.forEach(q => {
  console.log(`- ${q.question} (${q.upvotes} upvotes, ${q.comments} comments)`);
